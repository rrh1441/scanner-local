# Module Performance Report - Tier 1 Scanner

## Summary
- **Total Modules**: 17
- **Domain Tested**: vulnerable-test-site.vercel.app
- **Test Date**: 2025-08-15

## Module Status & Performance

### ✅ Fast Modules (< 100ms)
| Module | Time | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| client_secret_scanner | 3ms | Working |
| backend_exposure_scanner | 3ms | Working |
| denial_wallet_scan | 2ms | Working |
| abuse_intel_scan | 13ms | Working |

### ❌ Failed Modules
| Module | Issue | Fix Required |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| tls_scan | sslscan binary not found | Install sslscan in Docker image |
| whois_wrapper | Wrong Python script path | Fix path in module |
| ai_path_finder | Invalid OpenAI API key | Update API key in secrets |

### ⏱️ Potentially Hanging Modules
| Module | Suspected Issue |
|--------|----------------|
| endpoint_discovery | Hangs during crawl operation |
| nuclei | May be taking too long (>2 min) |
| accessibility_scan | Unknown - needs investigation |
| tech_stack_scan | Unknown - needs investigation |

### ❓ Unknown Status
- breach_directory_probe
- shodan_scan
- document_exposure
- spf_dmarc
- config_exposure
- asset_correlator

## Critical Issues

1. **endpoint_discovery** - This module appears to hang indefinitely during the crawl phase
2. **nuclei** - Running with baseline timeout of 45s but may be taking much longer
3. **Firestore** - Permission errors when running locally (not critical for production)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix path issue in whois_wrapper** - Module is looking for Python script in wrong location
2. **Update OpenAI API key** - Current key is invalid/expired
3. **Add timeout controls** to endpoint_discovery to prevent hanging
4. **Install sslscan** in Docker image for tls_scan module

### Performance Optimization
1. **Set module-specific timeouts**:
   - Fast modules: 5 seconds
   - Medium modules: 30 seconds
   - Heavy modules (nuclei, endpoint_discovery): 60 seconds max

2. **Consider moving to Tier 2**:
   - nuclei (if consistently slow)
   - accessibility_scan (if heavy)
   - endpoint_discovery (if it requires deep crawling)

## Next Steps

1. Fix the immediate errors (paths, API keys, missing binaries)
2. Add proper timeout handling to prevent hanging
3. Re-test all modules with proper timeouts
4. Move consistently slow modules to Tier 2

## Production Deployment Notes

The scanner is deployed but some modules are not functioning properly:
- Service URL: https://scanner-service-242181373909.us-central1.run.app
- Current revision: scanner-service-00031-qkh
- All 17 modules are configured but several are failing or hanging

**IMPORTANT**: The scanner may timeout on production due to hanging modules. Consider deploying with reduced module set until issues are resolved.
