- [x] **Nuclei consolidation**: Standardize nuclei usage across modules (nuclei.ts, techStackScan.ts, zapScan.ts) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Error Handling & Reliability

- [ ] **Circuit breaker pattern**: Implement in modules that make external API calls
- [ ] **Timeout handling**: Review and standardize timeouts across modules
- [ ] **Graceful degradation**: Ensure modules continue with reduced functionality when dependencies fail

### Performance & Concurrency
- [x] **Review concurrency limits**: Some modules have 20+ concurrent operations ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - **Analysis completed**: Identified high-concurrency modules and external API rate limiting needs
  - **webArchiveScanner.ts**: MAX_CONCURRENT_FETCHES = 12 ‚Üí recommended 6-8 
  - **dnsTwist.ts**: MAX_CONCURRENT_CHECKS = 15 ‚Üí recommended 8-10
  - **Tier config**: maxConcurrentRequests = 20 ‚Üí recommended 10-12
  - **aiPathFinder.ts**: Already reasonable (8-15 depending on tier)
  - **endpointDiscovery.ts**: MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 5, VIS_PROBE_CONCURRENCY = 5 ‚úÖ Good
- [x] **Rate limiting**: Implement in Shodan, BreachDirectory, GitHub API modules ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - **shodan.ts**: Already has RPS-based rate limiting ‚úÖ
  - **breachDirectoryProbe.ts**: Already has LEAKCHECK_RATE_LIMIT_MS = 350ms ‚úÖ  
  - **vulnerabilityAnalysis.ts**: Uses GITHUB_BATCH_DELAY = 1000ms ‚úÖ
  - **abuseIntelScan.ts**: Already has proper rate limiting with jitteredDelay() ‚úÖ
  - **dnsTwist.ts**: Added OpenAI API rate limiting with queue system ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Memory optimization**: Review techStackScan, documentExposure for memory leaks
- [ ] **Batch processing**: Optimize API calls in vulnerability modules

### Configuration & Deployment
- [ ] **Tier configuration**: Ensure all modules respect tier settings properly
- [ ] **Environment variables**: Standardize env var patterns across modules
- [ ] **Feature flags**: Add consistent feature flag support
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Add structured logging with module prefixes

### Security & Validation
- [ ] **Input sanitization**: Review all modules for injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Dependency validation**: Improve tool availability checks
- [ ] **Vulnerability deduplication**: Fix same CVEs reported from different scanners
- [ ] **Timeline validation**: Strengthen CVE timeline checks

## üìä **Phase 3: Testing & Validation**

### Test Coverage
- [ ] **Unit tests**: Add for each extracted module
- [ ] **Integration tests**: Ensure module interactions work correctly
- [ ] **Snapshot tests**: Validate zero-diff during refactoring
