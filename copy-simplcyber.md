### üí∞ **Cost Abuse Protection**
**We check**: If hackers can run up your cloud bills  
**Why it matters**: One misconfigured API cost a startup $72,000 in 6 hours  
**Real example**: "We found a rate-limiting bug that could have cost $50,000/month in AWS charges."

### üîë **Secret Exposure**
**We check**: If your API keys or passwords are visible online
