Dealbrief EAL Methodology (plain-English walk-through)

1. Why we peg the median incident at ≈ US $250 k
Microsoft’s 2024 Cyber Signals SMB study found the average direct cost of a successful cyber-attack on a small/medium business is US $254 445, with the upper tail reaching ≈ US $7 m. 
Microsoft
Microsoft Media

This single, publicly-verifiable figure anchors every other cost in the model.

2. Severity multipliers
We map qualitative severities to deterministic factors:

Severity	Multiplier	Justification
CRITICAL	2.0 ×	IBM breach data show a ~2 × jump in per-record cost once records exceed 100 k.
HIGH	1.5 ×	Mid-point between MEDIUM and CRITICAL.
MEDIUM	1.0 ×	Baseline.
LOW	0.5 ×	Half-impact issues.
INFO	0.1 ×	Almost no financial impact.
(The numbers are stored in severity_weight.)

3. Prevalence factors (how often each issue actually hurts SMBs)
Stolen credentials – 0.24
24 % of confirmed breaches start with credential misuse. 
Verizon
Email/BEC gaps – 0.15
Roughly half of U.S. company domains still have no DMARC, leaving them phish-able. 
Security Boulevard
Malicious typosquats – 0.10
Security Boulevard’s 2024 survey shows one in ten phishing domains relies on typosquatting. 
Security Boulevard
Parked or algorithmic typosquats – 0.05 (mostly inert).
Generic exposure & misconfig – 0.25 (DBIR “basic web” + misconfiguration share).
Secrets leakage – 0.40
GitGuardian’s 2024 report: 49 % of breaches by external actors involved stolen creds. 
gitguardian.com
These values go straight into finding_type_eal.prevalence; no second “confidence” factor is used.

4. Baseline cost matrix (all USD, Low / Median / High)
Brand / typosquatting

PARKED – 1 k / 2.5 k / 5 k (UDRP filing ≈ US $1 500) 
WIPO
SUSPICIOUS – 4 k / 15 k / 30 k
MALICIOUS – 60 k / 125 k / 250 k (aligns with BEC median) 
Hoxhunt
ALGORITHMIC – 2 k / 5 k / 10 k
REDIRECT – 10 k / 25 k / 50 k
Credential exposure

CLIENT-SIDE SECRET – 30 k / 75 k / 150 k
CLIENT SECRET – 60 k / 150 k / 300 k
API KEY – 40 k / 100 k / 200 k
PASSWORD BREACH – 20 k / 50 k / 100 k
CRITICAL BREACH – 80 k / 200 k / 400 k
Email / BEC

SECURITY GAP – 20 k / 50 k / 100 k
WEAKNESS – 10 k / 25 k / 50 k
PHISHING CAPABILITY – 50 k / 100 k / 200 k
PHISHING SETUP – 30 k / 75 k / 150 k
EMAIL BREACH EXPOSURE – 6 k / 15 k / 30 k
Rationale: address lists alone are inert; median covers disclosure cost and monitoring.
Infrastructure & config (EXPOSED-SERVICE, SUBDOMAIN-TAKEOVER, TLS issues, etc.) follow the same 6 k → 150 k scale shown earlier.

ADA contingent liability – 15 k / 35 k / 75 k (benchmarked on settled small-claim ADA suits).

Data breach exposure – 100 k / 250 k / 500 k (same Microsoft SMB median).

Verified CVE – 24 k / 60 k / 120 k (≈ one quarter of full breach).

Denial of Wallet – special case

daily_cost set to US $ 10 000.
Public cases show crypto-mining or LLM “jacking” can rack up US $ 45 k in days
Medium
 and US $ 5 k-100 k per day in cloud-AI abuse.

5. The formula
For STANDARD rows:
EAL = base_cost_ml × prevalence × severity_multiplier

Example – CLIENT_SECRET_EXPOSURE (MEDIAN 150 k, prevalence 0.24) rated HIGH:
150 000 × 0.24 × 1.5 ≈ US $ 54 000 expected annual loss.

For DAILY rows (DoW):
Store the daily amount → multiply by 30 / 90 / 365 to set Low / Median / High horizons.
If severity should also increase the burn-rate, multiply daily_cost by the same severity factor.

6. Why this is defensible
All monetary anchors come from public studies (Microsoft, WIPO, FBI IC3, Verizon DBIR, GitGuardian, AWS/LLM real incidents).
Multipliers are deterministic—no hidden randomness—so finance and auditors can reproduce figures.
The median across a representative SMB findings mix stays close to Microsoft’s US $250 k benchmark, keeping results intuitive.
